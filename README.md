The objective of this project is to build a regression model that predicts crop yield ($kg/ha$) using real-time sensor data. In precision agriculture, understanding how soil moisture and plant vigor (NDVI) at specific days after sowing (DAS) impact the final harvest is crucial. This model could help farmers identify early-season risks and optimize irrigation or fertilization before it's too late to save the yield.

## Problem statement
Crop yields are often only confirmed at harvest, leaving farmers with limited ability to adjust strategies mid-season when environmental conditions shift.

## Objective: 
To develop a Supervised Regression model that predicts the final crop yield ($kg/ha$) based on "growth-stage snapshots." By utilizing temporal data—specifically the time elapsed since sowing combined with real-time soil moisture and vegetation indices (NDVI)—this project aims to provide an early-warning system.

## Value: 
This enables precision-agriculture interventions (e.g., supplemental irrigation or fertilization) during critical growth windows, shifting farming from reactive to proactive management.
